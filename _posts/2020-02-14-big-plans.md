If you've arrived at hydractinia.org today, you might be a little disappointed. Where are all the pretty pictures of *Hydractinia*? Where's the cool home page with a rotating gallery? Where are the protocols? Why are all the pages just outlines of stuff to do?

The answer is simple. We (the Schnitzler, Frank, and Nicotra labs) are building this website *as you read this*! We want to prioritize getting useful information out to the cnidarian research community as *fast* as possible. And we have found that the quickest, easiest way to do this is by creating this bare-bones website on GitHub Pages using Jekyll. 

In the coming weeks you will see us create an entire page dedicated to helping anyone obtain and successfully culture their own *Hydractinia* colonies.
