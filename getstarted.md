### Obtaining *Hydractinia*

We recommend researchers interested in studying *Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus* begin with these two strains:

- **291-10** is a male *Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus* colony. It was bred in the [Nicotra lab](https://nicotralab.org) from parents collected at [Lighthouse Point, New Haven, CT](https://www.google.com/maps/place/41%C2%B014'54.1%22N+72%C2%B054'14.8%22W/@41.248362,-72.9046492,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!1m6!3m5!1s0x89e877f6386801eb:0x574e457ef42cdce2!2sLighthouse+Point+Park!8m2!3d41.2488564!4d-72.9035323!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d41.2483623!4d-72.9041023). It grows vigorously in the lab and, for this reason, is the animal that was sequenced for the [Hydractinia genome project](https://research.nhgri.nih.gov/hydractinia/).

- **295-8** is a female *Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus* colony. It has the same mother as colony 291-10. It's father was an inbred colony obtained by the Nicotra lab from [Leo Buss](https://eeb.yale.edu/people/faculty-affiliated/leo-buss). It grows well under laboratory conditions and, when fed well, reliably produces eggs.

To obtain these strains, contact [Christine Schnitzler](https://www.whitney.ufl.edu/people/current-research-faculty/christine-e-schnitzler-phd/), [Matthew Nicotra](http://www.nicotralab.org/people.html), or [Uri Frank](https://www.urifranklab.org/contact/).

### Setting up a tank

#### Overview



#### Materials
- One [standard 39 liter (10 gallon) glass aquarium tank](https://www.aqueon.com/products/aquariums/standard-glass-rectangle-aquariums)
- Artificial seawater at 29 parts per thousand. We recommend [Reef Crystals](http://www.instantocean.com/Products/Sea-Salt-Mixes/reef-crystals-sea-salt.aspx) or [Coral Pro](https://www.redseafish.com/red-sea-salts/coral-pro-salt/).
-	[Phos-Zorb Powder](https://www.apifishcare.com/product.php?p=details&id=548#.Xk1xIGhKhjE)

     ![Phos-Zorb](/assets/img/phoszorb.jpg)

- [Media Bags](http://usa.hagen.com/Aquatic/Media-Inserts/Clip-On/A1362) for the Phos-Zorb

-	One [Powerhead sized for a 20 gallon tank](http://usa.hagen.com/Aquatic/Pumps/Circulation/A585) to pull water through the sponge filter.

     ![Powerhead 20](/assets/img/powerhead20.jpg)

- One [Powerhead sized for a 30 gallon tank](http://usa.hagen.com/Aquatic/Pumps/Circulation/A586) for added water circulation.

     ![Powerhead 30](/assets/img/powerhead30.jpg)

-	Sponge filter for biological filtration. We recommend the [Hydro Sponge 2 Pro from Aquarium Technology](http://www.atisponge.com/products/hydro-sponge/)

#### Methods
1.	Rinse the aquarium with hot water. Then rinse with cold water and finally deionized-water (if available). Note: if you cannot rinse the tank with deionized water, then do your best to dry it out with paper towels to avoid leaving any tap water in it.

1.	Assemble the sponge filter and both powerheads.

1.	Place the filters and powerheads in a small bin filled with 29 ppt sea water to "get them going‚Äù and rinse the internal parts of the powerheads and filters.

1.	Place 50 ml Phos-Zorb powder into the media bag, then tie it closed.

1.	Tie the media bag to the top part of the sponge filter. (**need an image of this**)

1.	Place the sponge filter/media bag in the back left corner of the tank. (**need an image of this**)

1.	Place the 20 gallon powerhead on the sponge filter. *Use a short column to connect the bottom of the powerhead to the top of the filter to ensure a good seal. Adjust the height of the powerhead if needed.* **need an image of this**

1.  Secure the powerhead to the wall of the tank using the included bracket, which has suction cups that will allow you to attach it to the interior of the tank. (**need an image of this**)

1.	On the 30 gallon powerhead, insert the included air hose into the hole on the top of the diverter. (**need an image of this**)

1.	Use the included bracket to attach the 30 gallon powerhead to the rear interior of the tank, next to the sponge filter. (**need an image of this**)

1.	Fill the tank with 29 ppt artificial sea water.

1.	Plug in the powerheads and check to make sure they are actually running. Both powerheads should be completely submerged.

1. Ensure the free end of the air hose on the 30 gallon powerhead is not submerged. If assembled properly, you should see many air bubbles coming out of the powerhead. (**need an image of this**)
