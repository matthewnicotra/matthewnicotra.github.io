This website is supported by an [EDGE grant](https://nsfgov.home.blog/2019/09/17/the-cutting-edge-of-genomics/) from the [US National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) to develop methods for [conditional transgenics and markers for each *Hydractinia* cell type](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1923259&HistoricalAwards=false). The purpose of this website is to disseminate the results of this project and, at the same time, to serve as an online directory for *Hydractinia* related resources.


## Principle Investigators

Christy and members of the [Schnitzler Lab](https://www.whitney.ufl.edu/people/current-research-faculty/christine-e-schnitzler-phd/) study development, regeneration, and stem cells using *Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus*.  The lab engages in collaborative research and is committed to providing resources to others to study *Hydractinia*.


### Uri Frank
