This website is supported by an [EDGE grant](https://nsfgov.home.blog/2019/09/17/the-cutting-edge-of-genomics/) from the [US National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/). The scientific goals of the [project]((https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1923259&HistoricalAwards=false) are to develop methods for conditional transgenics and markers for each *Hydractinia* cell type, enabling researchers to manipulate gene expression with greater precision in this model.


## Principle Investigators

### Christine E. Schnitzler

Christy and members of the [Schnitzler Lab](https://www.whitney.ufl.edu/people/current-research-faculty/christine-e-schnitzler-phd/) study development, regeneration, and stem cells using *Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus*.  The lab engages in collaborative research and is committed to providing resources to others to study *Hydractinia*.


### Uri Frank

Uri and members of the [Frank Lab](https://www.urifranklab.org/) use *Hydractinia* to study basic questions development, stem cells, and regeneration.

### Matthew L. Nicotra

Matt and the rest of the [Nicotra Lab](http://www.nicotralab.org) study invertebrate allorecognition using *Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus* as a model system. The lab is also dedicated to helping new labs obtain and culture *Hydractinia*.
