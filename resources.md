#### Transcriptome Datasets

Dataset Name | Description     | Origin of Material | Link to Raw Reads | Link to Assembly | Publication(s)
------------ | --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------
Polyp-specific | Dataset includes four replicated libraries of feeding (nonreproductive) polyps (gastrozooids), two replicated libraries of female reproductive polyps (gonozooids), two replicated libraries of male reproductive polyps (gonozooids), and four replicated libraries of defensive (nonreproductive) polyps (dactylozooids).  | _Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus_ colonies collected in Woods Hole MA and purchased from Marine Biological Laboratories | [SRX474462](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRX474462) |[GAWH00000000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/GAWH00000000) | [Sanders, _et al._ (2014) BMC Genomics](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-406) <br> <br> [Sanders, _et al._ (2015) Genome Biology and Evolution](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evv153)
Polyp-specific | This project seeks to identify differentially expressed genes between different polyp and sex types in the colonial hydrozoan Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. Data included in this deposition include multiple replicate RNAseq datasets from male gonozoids, male gastrozoids, female gonozoids and female gastrozoids. Data were obtained using the HiSeq2000 platform  | _Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus_ colonies collected from Barnstable Harbor, MA, USA in July 2010 | [PRJNA244078](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/244078) |[Data Files on Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.98pt3) | [Plachetzki _et al._ (2014) Integrative & Comparative Biology](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-406)
